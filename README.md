# AWS-Honeypot-Attack-Data-Analysis
This study aims to analyze and predict the AWS Honeypot data, which comprises of various country source, host, prototype, and time related data to know the exact attacking patterns of the hackers. Also, the paper draws some regression analysis about further attacks, that could be pre-assumed (known in advance). Several patterns like type of protocol used, locale, peak time of attack and top source address can be addressed specific to a country and target chosen. So, this study helps us to understand the critical information and apply higher protection to those sources that are most targeted. Using concepts of machine learning like regression and analysis techniques we retrieved several out of bound patterns and visualized to produce interesting outcomes from a huge observation. Our contribution can be analyzed about understanding threat intelligence and investigate major attacks in various countries. As a result, the outcomes can be used before preparing a secure infrastructure.
